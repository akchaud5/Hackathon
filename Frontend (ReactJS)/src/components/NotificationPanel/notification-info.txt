This is your newly added notification system! Here's what's available:

1. Navigation:
   - Click the bell icon (ðŸ””) in the sidebar to access the Notification Center

2. Features:
   - Create custom notifications for any exam in your calendar
   - Set specific date and time for the first notification
   - Configure recurring intervals (5min, 15min, 30min, 1hr, 2hr, daily)
   - Add personalized reminder messages
   - Enable/disable notifications
   - Edit or delete notifications

3. How it works:
   - The system uses browser notifications to alert you
   - Notifications work even when you're on other tabs (as long as browser is open)
   - Recurring notifications will stop once the exam time has passed

4. To get started:
   - First add exams to your calendar from the search page
   - Then visit the Notification Center and click "Create New Notification"
   - Select an exam, set your notification preferences, and save
   
5. Permissions:
   - You'll need to allow browser notifications when prompted
   - This is a local system - notifications are stored in your browser

The notification system is completely independent from the calendar display,
but works with your calendar data to provide timely exam reminders.
